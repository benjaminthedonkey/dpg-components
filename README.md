## dpg-components

[DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) is a amazing library, and yet, I often find myself wishing there were a easy way to define reusable peaces of UI. From React JS documentation:  "A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page." Components are a powerful abstraction.   


The goal of this project is to test a few ideas on how to bring Components to DearPyGui. We want to use components the same way we use any other widget i.e using the same API. 


Examples under demo.py:

- Date Picker
- Data Grid
